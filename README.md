# SYNCS Hackathon

SYNCS Hack is a competition which challenges teams of six students to design, build and pitch an idea in 40 hours. This can be anything - be it a website, app, game, or even hardware. Our project is called “Mask Detection & Management (MDM)” which aims to track the percentage of people wearing face masks in indoor facilities where the infection can easily be spread such as hospitals, restaurants and gym centres. We hope our project can help the managers/security department at these venues to better prevent community transmission.

Our project is divided into 2 parts: a Self Check-in System with Face Mask Detection and a Management Application

### Self Check-in System
At the check-in counter of the venue, the visitor is required to fill in name and contact number for later infection tracing, following the COVID-19 Safety plan under the Public Health Orders in NSW. All of the information will be stored confidentially and securely in the system's database for 28 days. In the meantime, the camera setup at the check-in counter allows the system to recognize real-time video face to detect whether the visitor is wearing a face mask or not. No image recording occurs at this stage to protect the visitor’s identification.

### Management Application
If the visitor is not wearing a face mask, the system will record this visitor's status and send it to the \textit{Management Application}. At this stage, the admin has been noticed the situation and he can decide what to do next. If this happens in Victoria, he can turn on the “Automatic SMS” function on the app to let the system automatically send a warning message to this non-mask wearing visitor. If not, he can just simply keep his eyes on the percentage of non-mask wearers in the building. On the Management App, the admin can see all of the information of the visitors during the day in the "History" tab. There is also a "summary graph" and a "calendar" section to let him traceback if there are any confirmed cases on a specific date. The app allows the admin to send the SMS to visitors having high-risk of infection easily, just by clicking a few buttons.
